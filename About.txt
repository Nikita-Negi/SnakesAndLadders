The game Snakes and Ladders has enthralled generations of children, and gone through a few name changes along the way. 
I thought that I could use the intricacies of the subject to make a more entertaining and interactive project. 

A data structure is an arrangement of data in a computer's memory or even disk storage. 
An example of several common data structures are arrays, linked lists, binary trees, and hash tables etc. 
I intended to make our project different from others by using various functions.

The object of the game is to be the first player to reach the end by moving across the board from square one to the final square. 
Most boards wrap back and forth, so you move left to right across first row, then move up to the second and move right to left, and so on.

My aim with this project is to develop a better understanding about the subject data structures and algorithm and understand how they work
together and help us in solving major real world problems in this case the game of snakes and ladders.
